Group: Justin Kinsella and Devon Wardhttps://pong.justin-kinsella.com is the url for the website we built (it may say unsafe, but it will still work, as a sidenote)https://github.com/devoncward/creativeproject1.git is the github repositoryThe website was overall fun to build, and since it is a spoof website, it was easy to be creative in our designs as well. I spent a long time learning javascript for the website, and building the miniature ping pong ball and making it bounce across the screen was pretty tough at first, but now that I understand javascript a bit better I could do it much faster. I also spent time learning in bootstrap how to make different rows and columns. Using CSS actually proved very easy and fluid with the columns and rows, making them adaptable, and easy to put images in and position them as well. I feel I am getting a better grasp on how flexible html and css are, and how they can be used to customize almost anything. I am also improving in the way I can research problems I run into and solve them quickly, whereas before I sometimes got stuck on something and it took me a long time to finally get a work-around to the issue
